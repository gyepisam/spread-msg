Function: SP_connect
RETURN VALUES
       Returns ACCEPT_SESSION on success or one of the following errors ( < 0
       ):

       ILLEGAL_SPREAD
               The spread_name given to connect to was illegal for some
               reason. Usually because it was a unix socket on Windows95/NT,
               an improper format for a host or an illegal port number

       COULD_NOT_CONNECT
               Lower level socket calls failed to allow a connection to the
               specified spread daemon right now.

       CONNECTION_CLOSED
               During communication to establish the connection errors occured
               and the setup could not be completed.

       REJECT_VERSION
               The daemon or library has a version mismatch.

       REJECT_NO_NAME
               This is a protocol error which should not occur if the
               connection request is sent correctly to the daemon. It means
               that the length of the user name was not sent (if no user name
               is provided a length of 0 must be sent).

       REJECT_ILLEGAL_NAME
               Name provided violated some requirement (length or used an
               illegal character)

       REJECT_NOT_UNIQUE
               Name provided is not unique on this daemon. Recommended
               response is to try again with a different name.
