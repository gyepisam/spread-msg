Description:

The spread message library is a set of data structures and routines
to simplify message handling for clients that use the Spread Toolkit <http://www.spread.org> 

The core part of the library is spread_receive(..), which wraps SP_receive(...) and
parses the raw message into data structures representing the message type, each of which
has its own set of associated data.

There are data structures for the regular, membership, transition, and self leave messages.

Usage:

make all will create a test program test_recv_msg and two libraries.

test_recv_msg is hardcoded to connect to the spread daemon on localhost, join 'group0'
and print out any messages received. 
use the test programs in the test directory to exercise it.

sender.py sends out messages of varying sizes as fast as possible.
spmsg sends out messages provided on the command line then sends a 'quit' command
which causes test_recv_msg to terminate.

To use the library in your program, it's easiest to create a symlink to the directory
and add the proper incantations to your Makefile.
